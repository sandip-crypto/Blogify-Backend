        content: `
          <h2>Introduction to React Hooks</h2>
          <p>React Hooks revolutionized the way we write React components. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most commonly used hooks and how they can simplify your React development.</p>
          
          <h3>What are React Hooks?</h3>
          <p>Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the preferred way to write React components.</p>
          
          <h3>useState Hook</h3>
          <p>The useState hook allows you to add state to functional components. Here's a simple example:</p>
          
          <pre><code>
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
          </code></pre>
          
          <h3>useEffect Hook</h3>
          <p>The useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.</p>
          
          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Only call hooks at the top level of your React function</li>
            <li>Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions</li>
            <li>Use the ESLint plugin for hooks to catch common mistakes</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>React Hooks have made functional components much more powerful and are now the recommended approach for new React applications.</p>

          <h2>Creating Robust APIs</h2>
          <p>Building a well-structured RESTful API is crucial for modern web applications. In this tutorial, we'll create a complete API using Node.js and Express.</p>
          
          <h3>Setting Up the Project</h3>
          <p>First, let's initialize our project and install the necessary dependencies:</p>
          
          <pre><code>
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv
npm install -D nodemon
          </code></pre>
          
          <h3>Creating the Server</h3>
          <p>Let's start by creating a basic Express server with proper middleware setup.</p>
          
          <h3>Database Models</h3>
          <p>We'll use Mongoose to define our data models and interact with MongoDB.</p>
          
          <h3>Route Handlers</h3>
          <p>Implementing CRUD operations with proper error handling and validation.</p>
          
          <h3>Authentication & Authorization</h3>
          <p>Adding JWT-based authentication to secure our API endpoints.</p>
          
          <p>By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a production-ready API that follows REST conventions and best practices.</p>

        content: `
          <h2>Understanding CSS Layout Systems</h2>
          <p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are both powerful layout systems, but they serve different purposes. Let's explore when to use each one.</p>
          
          <h3>CSS Grid</h3>
          <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that excels at creating complex layouts with rows and columns.</p>
          
          <h4>Best Use Cases for Grid:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Complex page layouts</li>
            <li>Card-based designs</li>
            <li>Magazine-style layouts</li>
            <li>Any layout requiring precise positioning</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Flexbox</h3>
          <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that's perfect for distributing space and aligning items.</p>
          
          <h4>Best Use Cases for Flexbox:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Navigation bars</li>
            <li>Centering content</li>
            <li>Equal height columns</li>
            <li>Component-level layouts</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Can They Work Together?</h3>
          <p>Grid and Flexbox complement each other perfectly. Use Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for component-level arrangements.</p>
          
          <p>The key is understanding that Grid is for layout and Flexbox is for alignment and distribution.</p>
